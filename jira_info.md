## Completed Work

### 5/8/2025 - Import Structure Cleanup

Changed the import structure to make `src` the sources root. This involved:

1. Simplified import paths by removing all `jira_cleanup.src.` prefixes
2. Used relative imports within packages
3. Updated package configuration in setup.py

**Repository**: https://github.com/ldawson/repos/jira_cleanup
**Commit**: TBD (after pushing changes)
