# TRIL-297 Comment - Package Structure Consolidation Complete

The package structure consolidation for jiraclean has been successfully completed. All files have been migrated to the jiraclean namespace, and the redundant flat structure has been removed.

## Completed Work

1. **Migration of Remaining Directories and Files**:
   - Migrated all domain entities (Ticket, Action, Assessment)
   - Migrated domain services and interfaces
   - Migrated infrastructure repositories and services
   - Migrated YAML prompt templates
   - Updated import paths throughout the codebase to use jiraclean namespace

2. **Consolidation and Cleanup**:
   - Removed redundant files from the original flat structure
   - Fixed type safety issues in multiple files
   - Addressed potential null reference issues

3. **Verification**:
   - Successfully tested the functionality using:
     ```
     python -m jiraclean.main --project UHES --dry-run --max-tickets 2 --no-llm
     ```
   - Verified proper ticket retrieval and processing in dry run mode

4. **Final Structure**:
   - Established clean architecture with proper separation of concerns:
     - `src/jiraclean/domain/`: Core business logic, entities, and interfaces
     - `src/jiraclean/infrastructure/`: External system integrations
     - `src/jiraclean/iterators/`, `src/jiraclean/processors/`: Business process components
     - `src/jiraclean/utils/`, `src/jiraclean/prompts/`: Support utilities

## Documentation Updates

- Created a comprehensive migration status report
- Updated design decisions and migration audit documentation

## Next Steps

1. Add proper dependency management for external libraries (sqlalchemy, jira-python)
2. Enhance test coverage and error handling
3. Expand API documentation and usage examples
