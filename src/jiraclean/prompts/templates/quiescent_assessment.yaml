  Optimized prompt for assessing if a ticket is quiescent (stalled/inactive).
  This prompts the LLM to analyze a ticket and determine if it's quiescent,
  with enhanced scoring and natural language assessment.

  *************** QUIESCENCE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK ***************
  
  MANDATORY DISQUALIFIERS (check first):
  1. Tickets created less than 14 days ago are NEVER quiescent
  2. Tickets with ANY activity in the last 7 days are NOT quiescent
  3. Tickets explicitly scheduled for future execution are NOT quiescent

  QUIESCENCE INDICATORS (evaluate if passes above checks):
  
  **Primary Indicators:**
  - No meaningful updates for 14+ days
  - Unanswered questions or unaddressed blockers
  - Status doesn't reflect actual progress
  - Missed deadlines or commitments
  - Assignee non-responsive or unavailable
  
  **Contextual Factors by Type:**
  - **Bugs**: Severity vs. inactivity (critical bugs quiesce faster)
  - **Stories/Features**: Complexity vs. staleness (simple stories shouldn't stall)
  - **Tasks**: Clear deliverables vs. vague outcomes
  - **Epics**: Child ticket activity vs. epic-level progress

  **Staleness Scoring (1-10 scale):**
  - 1-3: Recently active, minor concerns
  - 4-6: Some staleness, needs attention
  - 7-8: Significantly stale, action required
  - 9-10: Severely stale, closure candidate

  Below is the complete ticket information in YAML format:

  ${ticket_yaml}

  Analyze this ticket for quiescence patterns and provide a comprehensive assessment.

  Your response must be in this exact JSON format:
  {
    "is_quiescent": true/false,
    "staleness_score": "Integer 1-10 indicating severity of staleness",
    "inactivity_days": "Number of days since last meaningful activity",
    "justification": "Clear explanation of quiescence assessment with specific evidence",
    "responsible_party": "Who should address this (assignee, reporter, or role)",
    "suggested_action": "Specific next step to reactivate or resolve the ticket",
    "suggested_deadline": "Realistic timeframe for action (e.g., '5 business days')",
    "planned_comment": "Professional comment for the ticket"
  }

  **Comment Generation Guidelines:**

  1. **Header**: Start with "[AUTOMATED QUIESCENCE ASSESSMENT]"

  2. **Assessment Summary**: 
     - State quiescence status clearly
     - Include staleness score and inactivity period
     - Provide brief reasoning

  3. **Specific Evidence**:
     - Reference specific dates, comments, or status changes
     - Highlight unanswered questions or blockers
     - Note any missed commitments or deadlines

  4. **Action Required**:
     - Clear, specific next step
     - Realistic deadline for response
     - Consequences of continued inactivity

  5. **Mentions**: Use [~username] format for:
     - Primary responsible party (assignee or reporter)
     - Secondary stakeholders if relevant
     - Product owner for feature-related tickets

  6. **Closure Warning** (only if staleness_score >= 8):
     - "If no response by [deadline], this ticket may be closed due to inactivity."
     - Use future dates only, calculated from current_date

  **Analysis Focus Areas:**
  - Time since last substantive update (not just field changes)
  - Presence of unanswered questions or requests
  - Alignment between status and actual progress
  - Ticket complexity vs. time invested
  - Team capacity and priority context

  **Quality Indicators for Assessment:**
  - Reference specific timestamps and activities
  - Consider ticket type and complexity
  - Account for team workflows and processes
  - Provide actionable, specific recommendations

  Only output valid JSON. Do not include explanatory text before or after the JSON.
