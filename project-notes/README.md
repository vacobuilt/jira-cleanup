# Project Notes

This directory contains project-specific tracking files and development notes that are not part of the main documentation structure.

## Contents

### Development Analysis
- **`current_functionality_analysis.md`** - Analysis of current system functionality and capabilities
- **`migration_report.md`** - Report on package structure migration progress

### Jira Integration Tracking
- **`jira_info.md`** - Project-specific Jira instance information and configuration
- **`jira_comment.md`** - Template and examples for Jira comments
- **`jira_comment_298.md`** - Specific Jira ticket comment tracking

## Purpose

These files serve as:
- **Development tracking**: Internal notes and analysis during development
- **Project-specific configuration**: Jira instance details and customizations
- **Historical record**: Documentation of specific decisions and implementations

## Usage

These files are primarily for:
- **Developers** working on the project who need context about specific implementations
- **Project maintainers** tracking progress and decisions
- **Historical reference** for understanding why certain choices were made

## Relationship to Main Documentation

Unlike the structured documentation in the `docs/` directory, these files are:
- **Project-specific** rather than general-purpose
- **Development-focused** rather than user-focused
- **Temporary or historical** rather than maintained documentation

For user-facing documentation, see the main [documentation structure](../docs/).

## Maintenance

These files are maintained as needed during development but are not part of the regular documentation update cycle. They may become outdated as the project evolves and should be considered supplementary to the main documentation.
