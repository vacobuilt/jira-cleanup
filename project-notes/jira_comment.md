# TRIL-297 - Implemented Pre-filtering and Enhanced LLM Error Handling

We've added significant improvements to performance and reliability in the latest update:

## Advanced LLM Error Handling

1. Added automatic retry mechanism for LLM API calls when JSON parsing fails
2. Enhanced system prompts with specific instructions when retrying failed calls
3. Implemented detailed logging to track all attempts, failures, and successes
4. Fixed the specific error causing JSON parsing failures (missing closing braces, unescaped characters)

## Efficient Ticket Pre-filtering System

1. Created a robust filtering framework that applies basic quiescence criteria early in the process:
   - Minimum age check (default: 14 days)
   - Recent activity check (default: no activity in last 7 days)
   - Status filtering (default: excludes Closed, Done, Resolved)

2. Enhanced ProjectTicketIterator to include configurable pre-filtering
   - Filters are applied before tickets are sent to the LLM
   - Added detailed statistics for tracking filtered vs. processed tickets
   - Implemented caching for full ticket data to avoid redundant API calls

3. Added a new process_project method to QuiescentTicketProcessor
   - Uses the filtering system to efficiently process entire projects
   - Includes detailed progress reporting and statistics

## Performance & Resource Benefits

- Significantly reduced number of LLM API calls (and associated costs)
- Improved speed by filtering out obvious non-quiescent tickets before expensive processing
- Added robust statistics tracking to measure filtering effectiveness
- Enhanced reliability through better error handling and recovery

## Documentation Updates

- Added detailed documentation of the filtering system in design_decisions.md
- Documented the improved LLM error handling approach
- Updated jira_info.md with the latest implementation details
