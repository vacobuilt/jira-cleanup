## Package Structure Consolidation Planning for TRIL-298

We've completed a comprehensive planning phase for the package structure consolidation:

### 1. Analysis and Documentation

- **Current State Analysis**:
  - Identified parallel package structures in flat (src/) and namespaced (src/jiraclean/) forms
  - Documented configuration mismatch between pyproject.toml and setup.py
  - Evaluated domain-driven architecture components (domain/, infrastructure/) for integration

- **Migration Planning**:
  - Created detailed, phased migration plan in next_steps.md
  - Developed a comprehensive audit framework in migration_audit.md
  - Updated design_decisions.md with the rationale for consolidation

### 2. Migration Tools

- **Comparison Utility**:
  - Developed migration_tools/compare_structures.py to analyze differences between structures
  - Tool categorizes files as identical, similar, flat-only, or jiraclean-only
  - Generates detailed migration report with prioritized recommendations

- **Documentation**:
  - Added clear usage instructions for migration tools
  - Created structured workflow for executing the consolidation

### 3. Next Steps

- Execute the audit phase to identify specific differences between implementations
- Remove setup.py in favor of Poetry's pyproject.toml configuration
- Systematically merge and migrate files from flat to jiraclean structure
- Integrate domain-driven architecture components
- Thoroughly test and validate the consolidated structure

All changes have been documented with clear justifications in design_decisions.md. The migration plan provides a systematic approach to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption.
