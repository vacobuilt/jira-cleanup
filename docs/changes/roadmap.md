### Advanced Analytics
**Status**: Future  
**Priority**: Low

- **Objective**: Provide advanced analytics and insights
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Historical trend analysis
  - Predictive modeling for ticket lifecycle
  - Team productivity metrics
  - Custom dashboard creation

## Long-term Vision

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Transition to event-driven architecture for better scalability
