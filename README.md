# Jira Cleanup

A configurable, policy-based tool for automated Jira ticket governance and lifecycle management.

## Overview

Jira Cleanup provides a robust framework for implementing governance policies across your Jira projects. It helps maintain clean and efficient Jira workspaces by identifying and addressing tickets that need attention, providing accountability, and closing tickets that are no longer relevant.

### Key Features

- **Automated Governance**: Apply customizable policies across configurable sets of Jira tickets
- **AI-Powered Assessment**: Optional LLM-based intelligent ticket analysis
- **Safe Testing**: Comprehensive dry-run mode for risk-free testing
- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment variables, command-line options, and template customization
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin-ready design for custom iterators, processors, and LLM providers
